In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT
COUNT(orderID)as orders_placed
FROM JanSales;

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) as orders_placed, Product
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in Februrary
SELECT acctnum
FROM customers cust

INNER JOIN FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid;

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in Janurary and what was the price?
SELECT
distinct(Product)
,MIN(price)
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product,price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in Janurary?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in Februrary at 548 Lincoln St. Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each 
--were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
sum(Quantity), 
product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in Februrary, and what was the
--average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
count(cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity)*price
FROM FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2;
