In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT
COUNT(orderID)as orders_placed
FROM JanSales;

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) as orders_placed, Product
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in Februrary
SELECT acctnum
FROM customers cust

INNER JOIN FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid;

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in Janurary and what was the price?
SELECT
distinct(Product)
,MIN(price)
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product,price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in Janurary?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in Februrary at 548 Lincoln St. Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each 
--were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
sum(Quantity), 
product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in Februrary, and what was the
--average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
count(cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity)*price
FROM FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2;

--List all of the products sold in Los Angeles in Februrary, and include how many of each were sold
SELECT
distinct product, SUM(quantity)
FROM FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

--How many locations are there in New York that sold more than 1 product in January?
SELECT COUNT(distinct location)
FROM JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%New York%'
GROUP BY Quantity >1;

--How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT SUM(Quantity) as quantity
,product
FROM FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product;

--What was the average amount spent per account in February? 
SELECT 
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales as Feb
LEFT JOIN customers as cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id;

--What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
SELECT
 sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id;

--Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT
product
,SUM(quantity*price) as 'revenue'
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY price
ORDER BY SUM(quantity*price) desc
LIMIT 1;
